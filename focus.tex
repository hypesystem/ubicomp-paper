\section{Focus}

Researchers of ubiquitous computing have been chasing fairies\footnote{Or have they? Sources.} by trying to reach
a point where small single-purpose computers exist. They need to embrace what is happening: devices.

(Maybe they already have? Check this...)

Maybe they should use a different term than ubiquitous computing? Pros and cons of this?

Security/privacy concerns. With the recent NSA scandal and the likes, people might want to be able to escape computers.
On the other hand, people are willingly using Google, etc., letting it track them. There seems to be a split. Some people
willingly and intentionally share \emph{everything}, some share a limited number of things, and a tiny group shares nothing
at all, making an effort to escape the surveilance.\footnote{Soruces on this?!} This choice would be entirely impossible
with true ubicomp.
