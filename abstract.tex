\begin{abstract}

In 2007, Bell and Dourish offered an alternative to the original definition of Ubiquitous
Computing, due to Weiser's 1991 paper.\cite{bell07}\cite{weiser91} The override of definition
discouraged discussion of the original idea and its desirability. The purpose of this paper is
to separate the new and old definitions of ubiquitous computing, and discuss the merits and
desirability of the original.
